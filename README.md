## The Business Value
In modern data environments, companies face two major hurdles: **Data Privacy (GDPR/HIPAA)** and **Data Integrity**.

Most "AI Data Assistants" require uploading sensitive raw data to a third-party cloud, risking privacy breaches. Furthermore, LLMs often "hallucinate" mathematical statistics.

## Validation
Tested against the same 10K insurance dataset used in my [Insurance Claims Prediction](https://github.com/CharSiu8/insurance-claims-prediction-logistic-regression) project. The auditor correctly identified the same 982 null values in `credit_score` and 957 in `annual_mileage` that I found through manual EDA—confirming the pipeline replicates expert-level data quality checks automatically.

**This project solves these issues by:**
1. **Local-First Auditing:** All statistical analysis (null detection, type inconsistency checks, date validation) happens locally using Pandas—raw data never leaves your machine. 
2. **Hybrid Intelligence:** Deterministic Python logic ensures 100% mathematical accuracy. AI is used only to *interpret* the pre-computed findings and suggest remediation plans.
3. **Automation:** Built as a modular pipeline that can be integrated into automated workflows, rather than a manual "chat" interface.
4. **Flexible AI Providers:** Choose between OpenAI (cloud) or Ollama (fully local)—enabling 100% offline operation for maximum privacy.

## Requirements
To ensure privacy and performance, VaultLens requires:
* **Python:** `3.7` or higher.
* **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux.
* **Key Dependencies:** `pandas`, `openai`, `requests`, `python-dotenv`.
